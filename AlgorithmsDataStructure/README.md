#Strategy

Suppose you don't know something and you'd like to know it

1. Guess. Don't just try any, try them all

2. Brute force  / Divide Conquer

3. Greedy / Heuristics

4. Dynamic = recursion + memoization + guessing => careful brute force

#Types
Dynamic programming algorithms.

Greedy algorithms.

Divide and conquer algorithms.

Simple recursive algorithms.

Backtracking algorithms.

Branch and bound algorithms.

Brute force algorithms.

Randomized algorithms.
