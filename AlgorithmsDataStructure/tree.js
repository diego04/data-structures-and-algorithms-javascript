/*

    trees are like graphs except their form is more restricted

    lets look at binary tree. they are DAGs
    with each node having at most two children
    left node being less than the parent and
    right node being more than the parent

    traversing trees can be done in DFS using:
    in-order
    pre-order
    post-order

    or BFS using:
    level order
